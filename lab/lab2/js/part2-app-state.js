  Lab 2, part 2: application state

  Spatial applications aren't typically as simple as putting data on a map. In addition, you'll usually need to change the stored data in response to user input. This lab walks you through writing a set of functions that are capable of building an interactive application.

  First, we'll need to write a function for loading points onto the map. Choose any dataset from part1 and write a function here to download it, parse it, make it into markers, and plot it. You'll know you've succeeded when you can see markers on the map.

  NOTE 1: When we have added markers to the map in the past, we have used a line like:

       L.marker([50.5, 30.5]).addTo(map);

       This is accomplishing two goals. L.marker([50.5, 30.5]) makes a marker and .addTo(map) adds that marker to the map. In this task, you will beasked to create separate functions: one to create markers and one to  add them to the map.

  NOTE 2: These functions are being called for you. Look to the bottom of this file to see where and how the functions you are defining will be used. Remember that function calls (e.g. func();) which are equal to a value (i.e. you  can set a var to it: var result = func();) must use the 'return' keyword.

       var justOne = function() {
         return 1;
       }
       var one = justOne();

/* =====================
  Define the function removeData so that it clears the markers you've written from the map. You'll know you've succeeded when the markers that were previously displayed are immediately removed from the map.

  In Leaflet, the syntax for removing one specific marker looks like this:

  map.removeLayer(marker);

  In real applications, this will typically happen in response to changes to the user's input.

  Optional, stretch goal

  Write the necessary code (however you can) to plot a filtered down version of the downloaded and parsed data.

  Note: You can add or remove from the code at the bottom of this file.
